//Notes -->

// Using Var Keyword is not recommended beacuse of the issue of block scope and fucntional scope
// Variables in JS can declared without using any keyword like let, var. Only Variable name is to be provided and varible is alloted a memory to store data
// This practice of declaring variables is never recommended
